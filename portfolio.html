    <h2>Computing Will Transform Society</h2>
    <p>
        Technology was created to better our lives and advance our understanding. This question as to whether or not it will change our society has a clear answer. Yes, it will change the way we as a culture interact with each other 
        and how we operate in our daily lives. It may allow us to communicate on distant planets in the future if need be. It is already happening on Mars with the rovers however, that is only once every three to twenty-two minutes. 
        We could improve on this making long distant calls like this practical. So the answer to the question whether or not it will change society is yes, yes it will greatly impact society.

    <h2>How is Lightbot like a computer? How is Lightbot different than a computer?</h2>
    <p>
        Lightbot is like a computer because it takes in inputs and then has an output. This is like when you type on a keyboard and then it is shown on the monitor. This is why Lightbot is like a computer, but it can also be different 
        than a computer. It is different than a computer because it isn't as powerful because it is limited to its set limits, while a computer has almost limitless amounts of power to use for computing.

            <b>Question 1:</b> They do this so you can understand if your code is working properly and if it isn't you know exactly where the issue is.
        </p>
        <p>    
            <b>Question 2:</b> Math homework makes you think about problem solving as it gets progressively harder and harder with the higher you make it. It is very similar to coding because the more complex the code gets the more 
            complex your issues become.
        </p>
        <p>    
            <b>Question 4:</b> A dual core can make it feel like it is running ten or more programs at once because it can simultaneously run them back to back making it feel like they are all running at once even though they are not.
        </p>
    <h2>Activity 1.1.4: Objects and Methods</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Question 1:</b> It will help that only one sprite will respond to that message because having over a hundred and them all responding at once probably won't go to well for the computer or scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Question 2:</b> Events are programed scripts that are only activated because the handler tells it to be activated. So the handler controls the events that are already scripted, but are only activated because something was 
            pressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Question 3:</b> Some the functions that are in the playg() are the horn only being activated because this one sprite tells the other sprite to activate only when a parameter is met. <b>B)</b> As many variations that are 
            needed because as long as the function is still working it is good.

    <h2>Activity 1.1.5: Variable Roles Part 1</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Question 1:</b> The primary advantage of using a fixed variable is so that if you use <b>"Magic Numbers"</b> and you want to chnage the speed of an object you don't have to switch every single value rather than just a 
            single one at the beginning of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Question 2:</b> <center><pre>I took a math test
        I got a 92%
        I got a 98%
        I got an 85%
    I passed first semester</pre></center>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Question 3:</b> One example of software that I have used that uses an accumulator would be a stopwatch with a lap counter. A second example would be if a game went on a linear path of levels as you beat a leavel it goes 
            up by one. <b>B)</b> I chose this because when you press the lap button it counts up from the last number by one because it is now the second lap or the third.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Question 4:</b> The accumulator counts the numbers that you have clicked and adds them. An aggregator compiles a list of values without adding them.

    <h2>Conclusion Questions</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Question 1:</b> The role of a stepper is to compile a list of consecutive whole numbers. A Walker is a message or a value assigned to each stepper. The role of a Best-so-far is like a highscore and takes the best possible 
        value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Question 2:</b> An application that I have used that uses a Best-so-far variable would be a game that uses a highscore system and takes the hiughest score either locally or globally

    <h2>Create Task Part 2</h2>
    <p>
        In my game, I created a side-scrolling RPG. One of the features that is included is the ability to jump and not fall through the floor. As showcased in the video the knight stays on the grass, and it acts like a solid floor. 
        This took a while to do because we had to play with the sprites. I created a sprite called floor and a variable called gravity. Gravity would increase by "x" amount until it reached its apex and would fall. However, he would 
        continually fall through the floor. We fixed this by adding that sprite and changed gravity until touched sprite "floor".

	  <h2>Conclusion Questions 1.2.2</h2>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 1:</b> Scratch and App Inventor are very similar in the fact that they both use drag and drop features. A piece of information not show in Scratch's script area would be sprites. This is because they have there 
	      won seperate section for sprites unlike App Inventor which allows them to be shown in the coding area as well.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 2:</b> It will change society because anyone can make their phone they want it to be. The average person would also be able to create any app to fit their exact needs. This will significantly change society because 
	      as mentioned earlier anything that anybody wants will be made. Everyone will be able to release their project or item and this will allow for anybody to search this up down to their specific needs. Once they searched it up they 
	      themselves would be able to look into the source code and edit something to match their needs, but by keeping it relatively the same.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Conclusion Questions 1.2.3</h3>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 1:</b> App Inventor is similar to Scratch because they are both drag and drop into it making them pretty similar. A difference between the two is that Scratch is only for computer games while App Inventor allows 
	      us to download it to our phones and use special features that a computer doesn't have.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 2:</b> Designing for a mobile app is different because there are some features that you can have while a computer program doesn't allow for rotation. You can also use a touch input and pressure. A computer program 
	      doesn't allow for much other than a click and input from the keyboard.

	  <h3>Conclusion Questions 1.3.3</h3>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 1:</b> An if statement says if the value is in here run this before anything else, but if it isn't found in their then it skips to the next section. An elif statemnt runs after an if statemnt pretty much doing the
	       exact same thing, but just after the initil if statement. An else statement runs the start of the code, but if nothing within those is a proper function it goes to that because it usually has no arguemnt and just says if it is
	        anything other than the defined pieces.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 2:</b> The boolean phrases that we have learned about are true and false. We have also learned about and, or, and not. A bollean expression found online is the AndElse statemnts. These exhibit behavior known as 
	      short-circuiting. A short-circuiting operator evaluates the left operand first. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 3:</b> All three of the students are correct. Eventually you are going to have to go back and change them if you need to and if you have more than just two of them it would be a pain to switch them over to that format.
	       If you were to define a variable you could just print the variable and then it would change it for every value instead of you having to change it for possibly a hundred print commands.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Conclusion Questions 1.3.4</h3>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 1:</b> With if-else structures, it helps if you can see the conditionals and make sure that both the if block and else block are executed. Glass box testing is when you can see the code and ensure your tests get into 
	      every corner of the code.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 2:</b> An if-elif-elif-else structure will always execute 1 block of code. An if-elif-elif (i.e., without the else) structure might execute 0 or 1 blocks of code. If the structure has nested conditions, several blocks 
	      of code might execute
	  </p>
	  <p>
	      <b>Question 3:</b> A test suite runs other code several times, providing different input or arguments, to make sure that the code will work as expected for specific test cases that cover a range of possibilities. Yes, I do feel like
	      it isn't a bad idea to write the test suites befoer the code is even written. This way you know exactly what you want to code and already have the tests completed and you just need to make the code match the tests.
	  </p>
	  <h2>1.3.8 Part 2</h2>
	     <p>
	         <b>Question 1:</b> The fastest sorting algorithm when the items are nearly sorted is the insertion method. It beats out everything by a longshot when it has 50 things to sort.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	         <b>Question 2:</b> Merge sort finishes everysingle one of them at the same amount of time. It may help when you need to sort something out in a certain time or need multiple lists to finish at the same time.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	         <b>Question 3:</b> The amount of guesses required to guarantee you the perfect amount of guesses would be 8. This is beacause if you guess June 30th and the ndivide if their birthday is before or after you would only need to 
	         guess 183 times, but if you guess the end of March you can then divide that agin in half.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	         <b>Question 4:</b> The unsorted list wouldn't matter when you guess a number. If you guess 7, but the list isn't sorted out like it should be and it is 3, 8, 10, 4, 7, 9, 6 and their number is 10 they would have to specify if the
	         number has  higher value, but is lower on the list. This wouldn't be pssoible with a single binary response.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	         <b>Question 5:</b> Google sorts their database out. If they didn't sort it out there might be a lack of efficiency in the search maybe taking a tenth of a second one time, but multiple seconds or even minutes another time. This is
	         why we know Google sorts it so they can efficiently find your search result.
	     </p>
	  <h2>1.3.10 Game Theory</h2>
	      <p>
	          <b>Question 1:</b> The game Rock, Paper, Scissors you have to decide what you want to play, but you don't know what the other person is going to play. Computer simuulations have chnaged social sciences is many ways. They have
	          helped war planners understand how certain things owuld react to eachother. Many astrophysicists use these simulations to simulate the collisions of planets. The uses of computer simulations are limitless mainly due to the
	          fact that anyone could actually use it for their own scientific findings.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	          <b>Question 2:</b> Abstraction: It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level. Abstraction is useful for coding because
	          you don't have to type out the entire section of code when you can just call the function that is already defined. Basically it is just saving the coder some work and possibly making the code more efficient.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	          <b>Question 3:</b> The abstraction's that we have created throuought our codes helped to contain the complexity of my code. It allowed for me to create a function that did a specific value, but instead of retping it out
	          multiple times if I were to use it again. It allows you to just call the function that you coded earlier in order to reduce the clutter of the code. Ultimately creating an abstraction helps to reduce the clutter that could be
	          created from having to type it out multiple times.
