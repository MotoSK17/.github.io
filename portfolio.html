    <h2>Computing Will Transform Society</h2>
      <p>Technology was created to better our lives and advance our understanding. This question as to whether or not it will change our society has a clear answer. Yes, it will change the way we as a culture interact with each other and how we operate in our daily lives. It may allow us to communicate on distant planets in the future if need be. It is already happening on Mars with the rovers however, that is only once every three to twenty-two minutes. We could improve on this making long distant calls like this practical. So the answer to the question whether or not it will change society is yes, yes it will greatly impact society.</p>
    <h2>How is Lightbot like a computer? How is Lightbot different than a computer?</h2>
      <p>Lightbot is like a computer because it takes in inputs and then has an output. This is like when you type on a keyboard and then it is shown on the monitor. This is why Lightbot is like a computer, but it can also be different than a computer. It is different than a computer because it isn't as powerful because it is limited to its set limits, while a computer has almost limitless amounts of power to use for computing.</p>
